# ðŸ“„ GitHub Repo Files Sync

For Common GitHub files across my repositories.

This repository contains common configuration files/GitHub Action workflows I use across my repositories.

Using the [action-github-file-sync](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/action-github-file-sync) Action the files/workflows are automatically kept in sync. It runs on every push and creates a PR in my other repositories if a file was changed.
